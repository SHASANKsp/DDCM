Aim & Objectives:

Creating a database comprising disease-causing mutations in genomic level, corresponding mRNA variants, related protein isoform as a product.

Overall Process plan:

We know that a mutation can be of several types and also it is random. But if a mutation in the gene level causes a change in the corresponding protein 
(as a change in amino acid residue due to change in triplet codon), then following post-translational modification the protein may function differently 
or lost its function as compared to its wild type. 

Therefore, our idea is to create a database where we will be showing 

1.The location of the mutation in the chromosome (as compared to the human genome mapping), the change in nucleotide from the original to the mutated one, 

2.The corresponding mRNA variants due to the mutation [Note: Even one gene can form multiple mRNA variants due to the phenomenon called Exon Skipping]. 

Hence, it will be our target to find the possible mRNA variants from the given genetic mutation. This can be done by using an open web software called 'Mutalyzer'.
There is a particular nomenclature called "Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) Nomenclature" that is used to indicate a particular mutation in a chromosome, 
gene (DNA), mRNA and protein isoform level. Hence our target will be to find all the corresponding variants caused by the mutation and to list them in a table-like 
manner as we create the database.
